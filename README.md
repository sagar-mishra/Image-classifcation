# Image-classifcation

This project is a template for image classification. <br>
<p>This includes everything require for image classification like directory structure, training file, testing file and flask application, we just need to do some configuration changes in config.py and slight modifications in this project as per our requirement. </p>

<h2>Directory structure: </h2>
* models : All models present in this directory, as of now I have included one custom model(base_conv_net.py) and one transfer learning model(resnext_model.py).
* resources : resources like data, images can be placed in this directory
* trained_model_weights: Trained weights exported to this directory, inside this separate directories will create for each model
* util : utilities file present in this directory like engine.py, inference_util.py, visualization_util.py etc.
